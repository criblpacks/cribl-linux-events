      comment: The Metric Processing Group cleans up the Splunk TA for Nix metrics by
        restructuring the metric data as a json structure before converting it
        to a metric, all fields on the event are set as dimensions of the
        metrics

      comment: the eval functions at the beginning and end of this pipeline are for
        measuring event processing time in the pipeline. to view, enable "show
        internal fields" on the sample, __a_start, __a_end, and __a_duration
        tell you when the event entered, exited, and the duration in the pipe.
